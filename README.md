# Algorithms in Rust! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/franleplant/algorithms.rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/franleplant/algorithms.rs)


I'm learning more about algorithms via an MIT Course and "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et. al.

In here I'm going to be putting all the Rust implementation for the studied material.


It requires Rust nightly due to the use of the `cargo bench` functionality
